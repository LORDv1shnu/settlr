## üêõ Recent Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Balance Calculation Fixes (October 2025)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Settlement Arithmetic**: Corrected backend logic where settlements were being applied backwards
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Expense Balance Calculation**: Resolved issue where expense payer's balance was doubled
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Groups Page Display**: Corrected inverted display logic showing positive balances as "You Owe"
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Member Balances Section**: Corrected member balance display in group details
- ‚úÖ **Added Settlement Tracking**: Migrated from localStorage to PostgreSQL for persistent settlement records
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard Settlement Integration**: Dashboard now properly fetches and applies settlements from database

### Technical Details
- **Sign Convention**: Positive (+) = you're owed money, Negative (-) = you owe money
- **Settlement Formula**: `fromUser += amount` (debt decreases), `toUser -= amount` (credit decreases)
- **Expense Formula**: `payer += (totalAmount - perPersonShare)`, `others -= perPersonShare`

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Basic user registration and authentication
- CORS enabled for frontend-backend communication
- Input validation on backend using Jakarta Validation
- SQL injection prevention via JPA/Hibernate

### Recommended for Production
- [ ] Add JWT or OAuth2 authentication
- [ ] Implement password encryption (BCrypt)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with SSL certificates
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Add audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add session management

---

## üöÄ Deployment
