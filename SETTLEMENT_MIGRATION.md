# Settlement System Migration: localStorage → Database

## Summary
Successfully migrated the settlement tracking system from browser localStorage to a proper database-backed solution.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Layer
**File**: `backend/add-settlements-table.sql`
- Created `settlements` table with columns:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `group_id` (foreign key → expense_groups)
  - `from_user_id` (foreign key → users) - person paying
  - `to_user_id` (foreign key → users) - person receiving
  - `amount` (decimal)
  - `settled_at` (timestamp)
  - `payment_method` (optional)
  - `notes` (optional)
- Added constraints for data integrity
- Created indexes for query performance

### 2. Backend - Entity Layer
**File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/settlr/backend/entity/Settlement.java`
- JPA entity mapping to settlements table
- Relationships to ExpenseGroup and User entities
- Validation and constructors

### 3. Backend - Repository Layer
**File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/settlr/backend/repository/SettlementRepository.java`
- JPA repository interface
- Custom query methods:
  - `findByGroupId()` - Get all settlements in a group
  - `findByUserId()` - Get settlements involving a user
  - `findByGroupIdAndUserId()` - Get settlements in a group for a user
  - `findByGroupIdAndUsers()` - Get settlements between two specific users

### 4. Backend - Service Layer
**File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/settlr/backend/service/SettlementService.java`
- Business logic for settlement operations
- Methods:
  - `createSettlement()` - Create new settlement with validation
  - `getSettlementsByGroup()` - Retrieve group settlements
  - `getSettlementsByUser()` - Retrieve user settlements
  - `getTotalSettledAmount()` - Calculate total settled between users
  - `deleteSettlement()` - Remove incorrect settlements

### 5. Backend - Controller Layer
**File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/settlr/backend/controller/SettlementController.java`
- REST API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/settlements` - Create new settlement
  - `GET /api/settlements/group/{groupId}` - Get group settlements
  - `GET /api/settlements/user/{userId}` - Get user settlements
  - `GET /api/settlements/group/{groupId}/user/{userId}` - Get settlements for user in group
  - `DELETE /api/settlements/{id}` - Delete settlement

**File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/settlr/backend/dto/SettlementDTO.java`
- Data transfer object for API responses

### 6. Backend - Balance Calculation Update
**File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/settlr/backend/service/ExpenseService.java`
- Updated `calculateUserBalances()` method to:
  1. Calculate gross balances from expenses
  2. Fetch settlements from database
  3. Subtract settlement amounts from gross balances
  4. Return net balances (after settlements)

### 7. Frontend - SettleUp Page
**File**: `frontend/src/components/SettleUp.js`
- **Removed**: localStorage `settledItems` state
- **Added**: `existingSettlements` state from API
- **Updated** `fetchGroupExpenses()`:
  - Now fetches both expenses AND settlements
  - Passes settlements to calculation function
- **Updated** `calculateSettlements()`:
  - Step 1: Calculate gross balances from expenses
  - Step 2: Subtract existing settlements
  - Step 3: Generate pending settlements to display
- **Updated** `markAsSettled()`:
  - Creates settlement via POST to `/api/settlements`
  - Refreshes data from server
  - Shows success/error messages

### 8. Frontend - Dashboard Page
**File**: `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js`
- **Removed**: localStorage `settledItems` logic
- **Simplified**: Balance calculation now relies on backend API
- Backend `/api/expenses/group/{id}/balances` already accounts for settlements

### 9. Frontend - Groups Page
**File**: `frontend/src/components/Groups.js`
- **Removed**: Complex localStorage settlement checking
- **Simplified**: `getUserBalance()` now uses backend API directly
- Backend balance calculation includes settlements automatically

## Architecture Before vs After

### Before (localStorage):
```
User marks settlement → Save to localStorage → Filter UI based on localStorage
❌ Not shared across devices
❌ Not shared between users
❌ Lost when browser cache cleared
❌ No audit trail
```

### After (Database):
```
User marks settlement → POST /api/settlements → Save to PostgreSQL → Backend recalculates balances
✅ Shared across all devices
✅ Visible to all users in group
✅ Persistent and reliable
✅ Full audit trail with timestamps
✅ Can track payment methods and notes
```

## API Endpoints Added

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/settlements` | Create a new settlement |
| GET | `/api/settlements/group/{groupId}` | Get all settlements for a group |
| GET | `/api/settlements/user/{userId}` | Get all settlements for a user |
| GET | `/api/settlements/group/{groupId}/user/{userId}` | Get settlements in a group for a user |
| DELETE | `/api/settlements/{id}` | Delete a settlement (for corrections) |

## Testing the Migration

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test workflow**:
   - Create users A and B
   - Create a group with both users
   - User A creates expense and splits with User B
   - Go to SettleUp page - should show User B owes User A
   - Mark as settled
   - Settlement should be saved to database
   - Balance should update immediately
   - Log in as User B - should NOT see the settlement (because it's settled)
   - Dashboard and Groups page should reflect the settlement

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Data Integrity**: Settlements are stored in a relational database with foreign keys
2. **Multi-Device**: Works across all devices and browsers
3. **Shared State**: All users see the same settlement status
4. **Audit Trail**: Track when settlements were made, payment method, notes
5. **History**: Can view settlement history for a group
6. **Rollback**: Can delete incorrect settlements
7. **Analytics**: Can generate reports on settlement patterns
8. **Scalability**: Database can handle large volumes of settlements

## Future Enhancements

1. Add settlement verification (both parties must confirm)
2. Add photo upload for payment proof
3. Add settlement reminders/notifications
4. Add settlement statistics and reports
5. Add partial settlements (pay in installments)
6. Add settlement disputes/resolution workflow
